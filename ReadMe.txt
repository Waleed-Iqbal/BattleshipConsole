A smaller version of Battleship.


Things that needs be improved.

-> Use interfaces
-> Improve the placement of ships from human input. That code needs to be more DRY.
-> Add comments.
-> More user friendly error messages to user for the invalid input.
-> Don't display opponent's ships on screen.
-> Overlapping ships validation while placing.
-> There is a out of bound exception while placing ships. It occurs very randomly. I wonder how and when that occurs?
-> Code is not as DRY as I wanted.
-> Make computer more intelligent. Use the same logic as the placement of ships to predict the location of human's ships.
-> More testing needs to be done for the invalid input scenarios.
