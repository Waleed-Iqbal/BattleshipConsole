A smaller version of Battleship.


Things that can be improved.

-> Use interfaces
-> Improve the placement of ships from human input. That code needs to be more DRY.
-> Add comments.
-> More user frieendly error messages to user for the invalid input.
-> Don't display opponent's ships on screen.
-> Overlappting ships validation while placing.
-> There is a out of bound exception while placing ships. It occurs very randomly. I wonder how and when that occurs?
